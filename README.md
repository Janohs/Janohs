# Hi, I'm Janot 👋

I'm an **Automation Engineer** who enjoys making things work *while I nap* (well, almost).  
Most of my days are spent wrangling APIs, connecting systems with **n8n**, and building backends that quietly get the job done.

---

## 💼 What I Do

- ⚙️ Automate workflows with **n8n** like it's second nature  
- 🧠 Build intelligent systems that *actually* make life easier  
- 🛠️ Write backend code that speaks fluent JSON  
- ☕ Optimize until the coffee runs out (and then optimize getting more coffee)

---

## 🧪 Current Experiments

- Playing with **AI agents** to run boring tasks while I enjoy the exciting ones  
- Tinkering with **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and serverless setups  
- Trying not to break production (but you know... it happens 😅)

---

## 💬 Talk to Me About

- Workflow automation  
- Building resilient backend systems  
- Why n8n is low-code but *not low-power*  
- The best snacks to debug with
